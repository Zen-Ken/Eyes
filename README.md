# Eyes
In this project I use DOM manipulation to animate pupils in an eyes.  This animated appears as it watching where you point your mouse cursor.  I use an event handler that reports the position of a mouse cursor, with the window width, height and some math we calculate a percentage with we use to set the realitive position of the eye pupils.
